Handy information


So what exactly is the advantage of using
<Switch />? The
<Switch /> component will only render the first route that matches/includes the path. Once it finds the first route that
matches the path, it will not look for any other matches. Not only that, it allows for nested routes to work properly,
which is something that
<Router /> will not be able to handle.
